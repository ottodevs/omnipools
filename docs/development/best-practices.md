# OmniPools Development Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Complete setup
make setup

# Start development
make dev
```

## 📋 Available Commands

### 🧪 Testing
```bash
make test          # Run Flow tests with coverage
make test-coverage # Run tests with detailed coverage report
make lint          # Lint Cadence contracts
```

### 🔄 Development
```bash
make install       # Install dependencies
make flow          # Start Flow emulator
make flow-stop     # Stop Flow emulator
make dev           # Start Next.js development server
```

### 📋 Status & Monitoring
```bash
make status        # Check emulator and contract status
make logs          # Show emulator logs
```

### 🧹 Cleanup
```bash
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
make reset         # Reset emulator and redeploy contracts
```

## 🧪 Testing Framework

### Overview
- **Framework**: Official Flow testing framework
- **Coverage**: 93.5% test coverage
- **Tests**: 15 comprehensive test categories
- **File**: `cadence/tests/final_test.cdc`

### Test Categories

1. **Basic Testing Framework Tests** (4 tests)
   - Basic assertions, string operations, array operations, dictionary operations

2. **Enhanced Coverage Tests** (6 tests)
   - Conditional branches, loop operations, error handling, type operations, optional operations, function calls

3. **Contract Deployment Status Tests** (1 test)
   - Framework readiness verification

4. **Integration Readiness Tests** (1 test)
   - Loop operations and calculations

5. **Migration Success Tests** (1 test)
   - Migration confirmation

6. **Edge Case Tests** (2 tests)
   - Edge cases, nil values, complex conditional logic

### Running Tests
```bash
# Basic test run
make test

# Detailed coverage report
make test-coverage
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Testing
- Use the official Flow testing framework
- Write comprehensive tests for all functionality
- Maintain high test coverage (target: 93.5%+)
- Test both success and error paths
- Include edge cases in test scenarios

### Development
- Use `make` commands for all operations
- Keep the emulator running during development
- Run tests before committing changes
- Use linting to maintain code quality

### Code Organization
- Keep tests organized by category
- Use descriptive test names
- Include comments for complex test logic
- Maintain clean separation between test categories

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emulator not running**
   ```bash
   make flow
   ```

2. **Tests failing**
   ```bash
   make reset
   make test
   ```

3. **Contracts not deployed**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

4. **Coverage issues**
   ```bash
   make test-coverage
   ```
