## Architecture

OmniPools consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts** (`/cadence`) - Flow blockchain contracts for pool management
2. **Web Application** (`/src`) - Next.js PWA for user interaction  
3. **Documentation** (`/docs`) - Integration guides and API references

## Flow Integration

All contracts deployed on Flow Testnet at `0x035662afa58bdc22`:

- **Registry** - Organization and user management
- **Vaults** - Pool creation and payout execution  
- **MockUSDC** - Test token for demonstrations
- **Flow Actions** - Cross-chain payout capabilities

### **Live Contracts:**
- **Vaults**: https://testnet.flowscan.io/contract/A.035662afa58bdc22.Vaults
- **Registry**: https://testnet.flowscan.io/contract/A.035662afa58bdc22.Registry
- **MockUSDC**: https://testnet.flowscan.io/contract/A.035662afa58bdc22.MockUSDC

See [Flow Integration Guide](docs/flow-integration.md) for detailed implementation.
