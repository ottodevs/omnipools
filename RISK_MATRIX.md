# ⚠️ Risk Matrix - ETHGlobal NY Demo

**Phase**: Block 1 (T+0 → T+25) Preflight  
**Context**: Flow emulator demo, 5-minute presentation window  
**Tolerance**: Zero tolerance for broken demo flow

## 🔥 TOP 5 RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### 1. **CRITICAL** - Emulator Crashes During Demo
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Show-stopping  
**Scenario**: Flow emulator process dies mid-presentation

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Pre-run `make reset` 30 minutes before demo
- ✅ Keep backup terminal with `make setup` ready
- ✅ Have static screenshots of working state
- 🔄 **Rollback**: `make reset && ./scripts/demo.sh` (takes ~30 seconds)

### 2. **HIGH** - Total Payout Shows $0 (Winner ID Mismatch)
**Probability**: High | **Impact**: Confusing to judges  
**Scenario**: UI shows 0 USDC due to participant/winner address mismatch

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Verified working snapshot in `public/data/vault-1.json` 
- ✅ Demo data toggle available in UI
- ✅ Hardcoded demo data shows correct 5000.00 USDC
- 🔄 **Rollback**: Click "Demo Data" toggle in UI (instant)

### 3. **HIGH** - Contract Import Failures
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Cannot deploy contracts  
**Scenario**: Last-minute file renames break cadence imports

**Mitigation**:
- 🔒 **FREEZE**: All `.cdc` file names and contract names
- ✅ Import paths documented in `FREEZE_NOTE.md`
- ✅ Tested import chain: Registry → Vaults → MockUSDC
- 🔄 **Rollback**: Git revert to last working commit

### 4. **MEDIUM** - UI Route 404s
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Cannot navigate demo  
**Scenario**: Next.js routing breaks, `/vault/1` not found

**Mitigation**:
- 🔒 **FREEZE**: Route paths `/` and `/vault/[id]`
- ✅ Verified routes exist and render
- ✅ Direct URL navigation as backup
- 🔄 **Rollback**: `bun run dev` restart + manual URL entry

### 5. **MEDIUM** - Package/Dependency Issues
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Build failures  
**Scenario**: Node modules corruption or bun issues [[memory:6399633]]

**Mitigation**:
- 🔒 **FREEZE**: `package.json` and `bun.lock`
- ✅ Verified working state with current dependencies
- ✅ React 19 confirmed stable [[memory:4985588]]
- 🔄 **Rollback**: `bun install` or `rm -rf node_modules && bun install`

## 📊 Risk Assessment Summary

| Risk Level | Count | Response Time |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Critical   | 1     | < 30 seconds  |
| High       | 2     | < 5 seconds   |
| Medium     | 2     | < 10 seconds  |

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

### **If Demo Completely Breaks** (Nuclear Option)
1. **Show static screenshots** from `assets/` folder
2. **Narrate the flow** without live interaction
3. **Reference working snapshot**: 5000.00 USDC payout completed
4. **Mention emulator nature**: "This is running on Flow emulator for demo"

### **If Network/Connectivity Issues**
- **Demo runs locally** - no external dependencies
- **Emulator is self-contained** - no internet required
- **UI is local** - no API calls to external services

### **Communication During Issues**
- **Stay calm**: "Let me quickly reset the demo environment"
- **Be transparent**: "This is running on emulator, typical of development flows"
- **Show confidence**: "The contracts and logic are working, just a setup issue"

## 🎯 Success Signals (Green Lights)
- ✅ Emulator status: `make status` shows running
- ✅ UI loads: Home page renders with vault link
- ✅ Vault page: Shows "Paid" status and 5000.00 USDC
- ✅ Data toggle: Both "Live" and "Demo" modes work
- ✅ Transaction executor: Payout button renders

## 📞 Ownership & Escalation
- **LE (Technical)**: Contract/emulator issues
- **DO (Risk)**: Mitigation execution
